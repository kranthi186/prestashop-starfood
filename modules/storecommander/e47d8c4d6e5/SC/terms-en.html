		<h3>2. A brief description of Store Commander</h3>

		<p>Store Commander is an internet- based software that allows the management of online shops. This software is available in a limited free version and a demonstration on a virtual shop can be made before purchase. Mise en Prod Sarl advises any person or company wishing to acquire the Store Commander software to install and use the free downloadable version at no cost on the website https://www.storecommander.com and / or to test the software on the virtual shop through the demonstration on our servers. These tests will enable him to verify the compatibility of the software with his computer hardware.</p>

		<p>The use of the software, including the free version, is subject to compliance with the license agreement attached to it.</p>

		<p>The functionalities of the software are updated regularly by Mise En Prod Sarl. The acquisition of the software includes a period of technical support and updating, this duration being determined when the software is ordered. For more information about the different technical support options, the user is invited to view the offers on the website https://www.storecommander.com.</p>

		<p>The STORE COMMANDER Software solution is exclusively reserved for e-commerce companies for the purposes of their main business.

		<h3>4. Expiry and renewal of technical support</h3>
